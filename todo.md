# TODO — Design Principles, v1 Scope

> **Append-only.** Never delete a line. Mark items done in place; if scope changes, add a new line explaining why rather than editing history away. Every edit to this file is stamped with the turncount it happened at (see `changelog.md` for what a turncount is and its current value).

## v1 definitive deliverables (locked at turncount 1)

This is the finish line for the current phase. Nothing beyond this list gets added until every box below is checked **and verified** (not assumed) — see "Completion checkpoint." Brainstormed against the original ask ("gold-standard SSOT for web design principles, exportable as skills/prompts") and then deliberately bounded, since that ask has no natural ceiling otherwise.

### Quantitative
- [x] *(turn 1)* 10 canonical principle pages in `docs/principles/`: visual-hierarchy, typography, color-contrast, spacing-layout, accessibility, responsive-design, performance, motion-feedback, forms-inputs, content-microcopy
- [x] *(turn 1)* 3 Claude Code skills in `/skills`: design-critique, accessibility-audit, plain-language-rewrite
- [x] *(turn 1)* 3 system prompts in `/prompts`: web-design-mentor, design-critique-reviewer, plain-language-rewriter
- [x] *(turn 1)* 1 verification script (`scripts/verify-site.py`, stdlib-only)
- [x] *(turn 2)* 2 GitHub Actions workflows (`pages.yml`, `ci.yml`, 2 jobs: verify-site, link-check) + 1 Dependabot config. Super-Linter was tried and removed by explicit user instruction after 3 rounds of real failures (see `changelog.md` turn 2) — `scripts/verify-site.py` plus real `html5validator`/`stylelint` runs already covered correctness without it.
- [x] *(turn 2)* CI confirmed green on GitHub Actions for a real push to `main` — run 30236119416 (commit `c4feedb`), both jobs (verify-site, link-check) `conclusion: success`, overall run `conclusion: success`. Checked via the GitHub API directly, not inferred.
- [x] *(turn 3)* GitHub Pages confirmed live — run 30272923087 (commit `76cc4db`), both jobs succeeded, deploy job log shows GitHub's own Pages API responding "Reported success!" for that exact commit. **Correction to the turn-1/2 record:** the assumed blocker ("Settings -> Pages -> Source must be set to GitHub Actions") was never actually confirmed from logs and turned out to be the wrong diagnosis — the real cause, confirmed from the actual GitHub API error via a GitHub Copilot PR, was the `github-pages` deployment environment's branch-restriction rule blocking `main` (see `changelog.md` turn 3). Fixed by removing the environment block from the deploy job. Not personally re-rendered the live page pixel-for-pixel (this sandbox's own network proxy blocks reaching `*.github.io`, independent of the site's real status) — this checkbox rests on GitHub's own deployment API confirmation, not a visual check.

### Qualitative acceptance criteria
- [x] *(turn 1)* Every principle page passes `scripts/verify-site.py` (skeleton sections present, links resolve, tags balanced)
- [x] *(turn 1)* Every HTML page passes the real W3C Nu Html Checker (`html5validator`) with 0 errors — verified by actually running it, not assumed
- [x] *(turn 1)* No deprecated CSS properties; 1 documented validator false-positive exception (`text-decoration-thickness`, a legitimate CSS Text Decoration Level 3 property the W3C CSS checker's property list hasn't caught up with)
- [x] *(turn 1)* Nav parity verified byte-for-byte across all 12 HTML pages (audited via script, not eyeballed)
- [x] *(turn 1)* Every skill links back to its canonical page instead of restating content (accessibility-audit was missing this link; fixed)
- [ ] *(blocked on user)* `main` is the repository's actual default branch (currently still the old feature branch in repo settings). No longer a functional blocker as of turn 3 — Pages now deploys fine from `main` via the environment-gate workaround regardless of what the default branch is set to — but still recommended for repo hygiene, and required if the environment protection (removed as a workaround) should ever be reinstated.
- [x] *(turn 3)* Repository visibility confirmed via GitHub's own API (`search_repositories`, not a webpage guess): `"private": false, "visibility": "public"`. This corrects a claim made in conversation that the repo was private — it is not.

## Explicitly OUT of scope for v1 (deferred, not forgotten)

- Additional principle pages beyond the 10 locked above
- Additional skills/prompts beyond the 6 locked above
- Visual/design-system overhaul of the site itself
- Site search, i18n/translation, analytics, SEO tooling
- Additional MCP integrations beyond the ones selected in `codemap.json`'s `_meta.mcp_selection`
- External task trackers (Todoist, Notion, Sanity, Craft, Superhuman Docs) as a parallel system to this file — rejected as a DRY violation; this file is the one source of truth for task state

## Completion checkpoint

v1 is DONE when every box above is checked and independently verified (a workflow run actually observed green, not inferred). At that point: stop, report status, and wait for explicit go-ahead before starting any v2 work.

**Status as of turn 3: every functional item is checked and verified, including the site being live.** The one remaining box (`main` as the actual default branch) is a repo-settings change no available tool can make, and is now cosmetic/hygiene only, not a functional blocker. **v1 is complete.**
